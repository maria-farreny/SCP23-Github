# The purpose of this project is to create a diabetes tracking app. It will help the users monitor and manage their diabetes-related information. 
To access your information, you need to provide with the username and password. By doing so, we protect your data.

The features contained in this app:
1.	User information.
2.	Medication.
3.	Sugar levels.
4.	Food.
5.	Calendar.
6.	Symptomatology
With all this pages, you can store all information that can be relevant for you and for your doctor. The aim is to create a place where you can monitor all this data, and when needed download all this on your phone.

To correctly install this, you need to download all the files (they are not provided) and the csv that contain all the store data (also not provided). After that, you only need to run the Principal.ipynb file. The libraries needed to be able to use this app are pandas1 and tkcalendar2. All available from Anaconda3.
